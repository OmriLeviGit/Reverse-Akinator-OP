adding metadata to the vector db:
- attempt to get the first main arc a character appeared
- add a tag to each paragraph (which arc does this info belong to if it occurred in a specific arc)

to actually do:
- fill up description and fun fact
- make affiliations searchable
- look at obsidian list

manual:
- remove all characters with a certain section (geography, Inhabitants)
- remove imu stuff like that

spoiler attempts:
- check how well it works if messages are not bound to a single character
