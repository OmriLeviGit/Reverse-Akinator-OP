manual:
- ignore all characters with a certain section (geography, Inhabitants)

adding metadata to the vector db:
- attempt to get the first main arc a character appeared
- add a tag to each paragraph (which arc does this info belong to if it occurred in a specific arc)

spoiler attempts:
- check how well it works if messages are not bound to a single character
