manual:
- ignore all characters with a certain section (geography, Inhabitants)

adding metadata to the vector db:
- attempt to get the first main arc a character appeared
- add a tag to each paragraph (which arc does this info belong to if it occurred in a specific arc)


- check how well it works if messages are not bound to a single character

---
create a test suite
prompt the llm to create the chroma query
use unambiguous language
limit message size
enforce alphanumeric

basic attributes (citizen, animal, is captain, species) adherence is bad
zoro hachi good example to check
fix back up

maybe add the reasoning to the chat's context so it would be able to follow a chain of throughts
