adding metadata to the vector db (for the anti spoiler mechanism):
- attempt to get the first *main* arc for a character, rather than the first actual appearance

---
rag and chroma:
- prompt the llm to create the chroma query (check the latency on that as well)
- check how well it works if messages are not bound to a single character
- add the reasoning to the chat's context so it would be able to follow a chain of thoughts
- add a graph knowledge

---
in-code:
- make search use epithet and alias.
- move the structured data from chroma to sqlite. split the discovery and the database set up into 2 separate steps in the bootstrapping script
- change the word "ignore" to "exclude"
- show the chat history with the llm with the reasoning in the post game

---
utility:
- create a script that rates all character with non colored (anime) image a certain way

---
performance:
- create a test suite for prompts (currently not added as this burns through the daily limit anyways)
