adding metadata to the vector db:
- attempt to get the first *main* arc a character appeared, isntead first actual appearance (for the anti spoiler mechanism)

---
rag and chroma:
- prompt the llm to create the chroma query
- check how well it works if messages are not bound to a single character
- add the reasoning to the chat's context so it would be able to follow a chain of thoughts

---
logic:
- make search use epithet and alias

performance:
- create a test suite for prompts
