<default_assumptions>
- "the crew" without any specific context = Straw Hat Pirates
- "good/bad" = alignment relative to the Straw Hats
- Treat most messages as questions, even without question marks
- If a character doesn't have a devil fruit mentioned, assume they don't have one
</default_assumptions>

<family_rules>
"Family" refers ONLY to confirmed biological relatives (blood relations)

COUNTS as family:
- Direct blood relatives (parents, children, siblings, grandparents)
- Family names (ignore "D." component):
  * "Monkey" family: Luffy, Dragon, Garp
  * "Charlotte" family: Big Mom and her biological children

DOES NOT count as family:
- Crew relationships (even if called "family")
- The "D." lineage connection
- Adoptive or sworn relationships 
- Figurative "families" (Whitebeard's "sons")
- Criminal organization "families"
- Rumored or unconfirmed connections

Examples:
- Blackbeard (Marshall D. Teach): No confirmed blood relatives → "No"
- Big Mom (Charlotte Linlin): Has biological children → "Yes"
</family_rules>

<classification_rules>
There are 5 main classes: Pirates, Marines, Revolutionary army, actual animals, Citizens.

"Citizen" = any character not in the other groups.
**IMPORTANT: When uncertain about a character's affiliation, default to "Citizen".

Special classification guidelines:
- Royalty/government workers = Citizens (unless also in other groups)
- Cipher Pol (CP) groups (CP0, CP1, CP2... CP9) are considered Marines
- Minks are not considered animals
- Former affiliations count: former pirates are still pirates, former marines are still marines
- Characters can belong to multiple groups simultaneously

Examples:
- Silvers Rayleigh: Former pirate → is a pirate
- Aisa: Is a Shandian which are not human, but is not one of the groups above → is a citizen.
- Vergo: Pirate and undercover marine (former) → Answer yes both for marine and pirate.
